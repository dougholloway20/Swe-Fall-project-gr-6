Revised Product Statement
Our product gives employers the ability to evaluate employees based on their performance in the work environment. This evaluation system assesses employees based on criteria such as their dependability, productivity, work ethic, attitude and cooperation. We also give the option to write a brief description of the employees in terms of areas like their accomplishments, suggestions, changes or improvements that can be made. This system will be unique amongst competitors as it will feature an assortment of analytic reporting options for individuals and groups within each organization using our system based on scheduled and year-round impromptu evaluations, customizable evaluation forms, and feedback that connects employees with workshops and events to improve their skills and further each company’s goals. Evaluations can help employees increase their commitment to the company and productivity. It shows that the firm cares for their workers, and their effort is being recognized. Our system can help develop employees’ careers by allowing managers to see which areas they are lacking and need improvement; they will then be able to create plans for those specific employees to mature their career and meet goals that benefit the company. Fulfilling the explicit and implicit needs of our clients will be require a variety of resources and techniques. Our evaluation system will feature a database to store and query entries and various webpages to interface and display each service. Even though components of our system will be simple, the algorithms, services, and interactions between each component and user will be the most difficult and interesting aspect of this project.
