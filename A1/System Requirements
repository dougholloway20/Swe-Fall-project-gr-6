The evaluation system will feature a component for data entry (Employee Review Form) and a database to store and query entries. Employees
will interact with the data entry portion of the system to evaluate their peers and themselves while employers will be able to interact 
with both the data entry and database components. The data entry component will contain four sections: an information section consisting 
of Person Being Evaluated, Employee ID# (if self evaluating), Position, Department, Manager/Supervisor; a rating scale section to evaluate 
levels of Communication/Listening Skills, Dependability, Productivity, Job Knowledge, Technical Skills, Work Quality, Attitude, Attendance/
Punctuality, Initiative, Creativity, Technical Skills, Cooperation; a short answer section that will allow employees to provide brief
statements about the person being evaluated in regards to Accomplishments, Strengths Weaknesses, Suggested Training, Other Improvement 
Suggestions, and Other Remarks; and an optional custom evaluation metric section that will enable employees to suggest/implement an
additional evaluation criteria in either a rating scale or short answer style. The database will then record these evaluation and query
them for use by the employer based on query options such as Quarter, Individual over Time, Department, or Position.
